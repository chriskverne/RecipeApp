# Recipe Management System (RMS)

## Overview
The Recipe Management System (RMS) is a web-based application designed to provide an easy and efficient way to search, organize, and record recipes. With the vast number of recipes available online, it can be challenging for users to recall and search for specific recipes, store their favorites, or plan a menu. RMS simplifies these tasks by allowing users to search for recipes, add them to their personal list, and generate ingredient lists for groceries.

RMS is tailored for food enthusiasts, including both home cooks and professional chefs, who want to streamline their cooking tasks using a modern computing tool. Whether you're looking to discover new recipes or organize your tried-and-true favorites, RMS supports you every step of the way. Our goal is to create a user-friendly environment that makes cooking more affordable, organized, and enjoyable.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Node.js**  
   If Node.js is not installed, verify by running:  
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```
   If itâ€™s not installed, download it from the Node.js Official Website.

2. **Port Already in Use**  
   If port 3000 is already in use, stop any process using the port or run the server on a different port:
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- --port=4000
   ```
   
3. **Permission Denied on Linux**  
   On Linux systems, if you encounter permission issues, prepend commands with sudo:
   ```bash
   sudo npm install
   sudo npm run dev
   ```
